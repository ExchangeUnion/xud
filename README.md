![xud logo](logo.png)

The Exchange Union Daemon ([`xud`](https://github.com/ExchangeUnion/xud)) is the open-source node software powering [Exchange Union](https://www.exchangeunion.com/), a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the [Lightning](https://lightning.network/) and [Raiden](https://raiden.network/) network.

`xud` brings individuals and exchanges onto the same network to form a single global liquidity pool. This gives users a choice to either trade directly on the DEX by running `xud`, managing private keys and software stack, *or* to conveniently trade via a trusted exchange. Exchanges benefit from access to the network's aggregated liquidity and can provide deeper order books and new trading pairs to their users. `xud` encompasses the following components:

* Integration with [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) and [raiden](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden) nodes.
* Decentralized order book to locally aggregate orders from the known network.
* Matching engine to match new local orders with existing local and remote orders and initiate atomic swaps with remote peers.
* Peer-to-peer networking with and discovery of other nodes.
* [gRPC API](https://grpc.io/) with web proxy to serve other applications, also accessible via the command-line interface `xucli`.

## Documentation

The daemon has been designed to be as developer friendly as possible in order to facilitate application development on top of `xud`.
* [docs.exchangeunion.com](https://docs.exchangeunion.com): the starting point and up-to-date collection of guides, links and examples
* [api.exchangeunion.com](https://api.exchangeunion.com): The automatically generated gRPC API documentation
* [typedoc.exchangeunion.com](https://typedoc.exchangeunion.com/): The automatically generated code documentation

## Installation

This section contains brief instructions for installing `xud` manually, without treating setup of dependencies like `bitcoind` or `lnd`. It is mainly geared towards developers. For all other users, we recommend our streamlined [xud-docker](https://docs.exchangeunion.com/start-trading) setup.

If you already have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (latest or LTS) installed, you can install `xud` via npm by running

```bash
sudo npm install xud -g --unsafe-perm
```

Detailed instructions for installing `xud` can be found in the [docs for developers](https://docs.exchangeunion.com/development).

## Usage

Launch `xud`:

```
./xud
2018-9-11 01:11:59 [GLOBAL] info: config loaded
2018-9-11 01:11:59 [GLOBAL] info: Local nodePubKey is 029a96c975d301c1c8787fcb4647b5be65a3b8d8a70153ff72e3eac73759e5e345
2018-9-11 01:11:59 [DB] info: connected to database. host:localhost port:3306 database:xud
2018-9-11 01:11:59 [P2P] info: p2p server listening on 0.0.0.0:8885
2018-9-11 01:11:59 [RPC] info: gRPC server listening on localhost:8886
```

Open a new terminal and issue commands to `xud` with the `xucli` command line tool. To see a list of available commands, run:

```
./xucli --help
```

You can find more information on how to use & configure `xud` in the [docs for developers](https://docs.exchangeunion.com/development).

Note: If you installed `xud` globally via npm, you can run `xud` and `xucli` from anywhere. Otherwise you must run them from the `bin` folder.
