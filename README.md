# Exchange Union

[Exchange Union](https://www.exchangeunion.com/) (XU) is a decentralized exchange layer built on the [Lightning](http://lightning.network/) and [Raiden](https://raiden.network/) networks to enable trustless and instant cryptocurrency swaps and order fulfillment between exchanges.

This repo contains the early stages of the Exchange Union Daemon ("xud") which encompasses the following components:

* Integration with [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) and [raiden](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden) nodes.
* Orderbook data stored in a local mysql/mariadb database.
* Peer-to-peer networking with other XU nodes via TCP.
* A JSON-RPC API to serve other applications and a command-line interface.

Contributions, feedback, and questions are welcome.

## Install

First, clone the repository from GitHub and install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ExchangeUnion/xud
cd xud
npm install
```

Xud uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/). You will have to install one of those and create a user and database grant all permissions for the new database to the new user.

## Starting the Daemon

```bash
~/xud $ cd bin
~/xud/bin $ ./xud
2018-3-2 11:36:06 - info: config loaded
2018-3-2 11:36:06 - info: connected to database
2018-3-2 11:36:06 - info: P2P server listening on port 8885
2018-3-2 11:36:06 - info: RPC server listening on port 8886
```

## Command-Line Interface

```bash
~/xud/bin $ ./xucli placeorder --price 0.12 --quantity 5
{"fieldCount":0,"affectedRows":1,"insertId":1,"serverStatus":2,"warningCount":0,"message":"","protocol41":true,"changedRows":0}
~/xud/bin $ ./xucli getorders
{"bids":[{"price":0.12,"quantity":5}],"asks":[]}
```

## Configuration

The configuration file uses [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) and by default is located at  `~/.xud/xud.conf` on Linux or `AppData\Local\Xud\xud.conf` on Windows. Default settings which can be overridden are shown below.

```toml
lndDir = "~/.lnd"
rpcPort = 8886

[db]
username = "xud"
password = ""
database = "xud"
port = 3306
host = "localhost"

[p2p]
listen = true
port = 8885
```
