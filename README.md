The Exchange Union Daemon (`xud`) powers [Exchange Union](https://www.exchangeunion.com/), a decentralized exchange built on the [Lightning](http://lightning.network/) and [Raiden](https://raiden.network/) networks to enable instant and trustless cryptocurrency swaps and order fulfillment between cryptocurrency exchanges. Exchanges participating in the network aggregate their liquidity and can provide deeper order books and new trading pairs to their users. `xud` encompasses the following components:

* Integration with [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) and [raiden](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden) nodes.
* Decentralized order book to locally aggregate orders from the known network.
* Matching engine to match new local orders with existing local and remote orders and initiate atomic swaps.
* Peer-to-peer networking with other XU nodes.
* gRPC API with web proxy to serve other applications, also accessible via the command-line interface `xucli`.
