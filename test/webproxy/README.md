# Data-Driven Test Development (DDTD)

The webproxy is implemented through a DDTD methodology, which consists in using a classical TDD cycle:

- Add a test
- Write something in the test
- Let it fail at the beginning
- Refactor the code of your class/library
- Make the test pass

And so on, iterating through this process until the functionality being implemented is okay. We're using sample data stored in JSON files.

## Run the tests

All tests:

    npm run test:webproxy

One test in particular:

    node node_modules/.bin/mocha -r ts-node/register test/webproxy/nodeinfo/HttpStatus422.spec.ts

## Conventions

The subfolders in `test/webproxy` represent the HTTP endpoints available:

- `addcurrency`
- `info`
- `removeorder`
- `...`

The files are named according to the HTTP status code expected:

- `HttpStatus200.spec.ts`
- `HttpStatus400.spec.ts`
- `...`

Here is the output obtained when running the tests:

```
api/v1/info
  âœ“ GET responds with http status 200 (95ms)
  ...
```
