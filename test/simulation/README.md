# Xud Simulation Tests

This test suite simulates real usage of `xud` and the second-layer payment channel network clients that it interacts with. It creates chains, generates blocks, and establishes payment channels. All commands to `xud` are issued via the gRPC API. This helps ensure that `xud` integrates with other nodes and software components properly and allows for more complete and realistic testing of `xud`.

--- 

The simulation testsâ€™ only dependencies are [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Usage (via `xud` npm scripts)

#### Run all test suites after building all images:

```bash
$ npm run test:sim:build
$ npm run test:sim:run
```

#### Run every test suite separately after building all images:

```bash
$ npm run test:sim:build
$ npm run test:sim:run:integration
$ npm run test:sim:run:security
$ npm run test:sim:run:stability

```

#### Specific image builds

When making changes to the simulation test code, one must build the `test` image before rerunning the tests:

```bash
$ npm run test:sim:build:test
$ npm run test:sim:run
```

When making changes to non-test `xud` code, one must build the `xud` image and clean its volume before rerunning the tests:
 
```bash
$ npm run test:sim:clean:xud
$ npm run test:sim:build:xud
$ npm run test:sim:run
```

When making changes to `lnd` version/tag, one must build the `lnd` image and clean its volume before rerunning the tests:

```bash
$ npm run test:sim:clean:lnd
$ npm run test:sim:build:lnd
$ npm run test:sim:run
```

#### About `custom-xud`

`custom-xud` is a modified version of `xud` used to simulate different custom behaviours (adversarial or instability), which are used in the Security/Instability test suites.

The mechanism in which `custom-xud` is created is via the git patch file named `custom-xud.patch`.

To modify the patch, one should first apply it to the current working tree (it is advisable to stash or commit current changes before doing so):

```bash
$ npm run test:sim:custom-xud:apply
```

To reverse the applied patch, and restore previous working tree state:

```bash
$ npm run test:sim:custom-xud:reverse
```

To override the patch with new changes from the current working tree:

```bash
$ npm run test:sim:custom-xud:patch
```

To run the tests with the modified patch, one must build the `xud` image and clean its `custom-xud` volume before rerunning the tests:

 ```bash
 $ npm run test:sim:clean:custom-xud
 $ npm run test:sim:build:xud
 $ npm run test:sim:run
 ```

 #### Logs

Upon every test run, all of `xud` & `lnd` nodes logs are being directed to `temp/logs`. 

For printing them unto console:
```bash
$ npm run test:sim:logs
```

## Simulation Test Cases

Below is a list of implemented (checked) and planned (unchecked) test cases.

### Initialization

- [x] Verify connectivity to swap clients of all nodes.
- [x] Add currencies and pairs to all nodes.

### P2P

- [x] Discovery: Connect Alice to Bob, Bob to Carol, Dave to Carol. After a short while, all of them should end up connected.
- [x] Incorrect public key: Alice connects to Bob expecting an incorrect public key. Bob should reject the connection due to auth invalid target.
- [x] Banning: If Alice ban Bob, connection attempts from both directions should fail.
- [x] Unbanning: If Alice unban Bob, connection attempts from both directions should succeed.
- [x] Duplicate connection: If Alice and Bob are already connected, connection attempts from both directions should fail.

### Decentralized Order Book

- [x] Placed order should get broadcasted over the network, and added to connected peers' order books.
- [x] Removed order should get invalidated over the network, and removed from connected peers' order books.
- [ ] Placed order should get internal matches, and trigger order invalidation over the network.
- [ ] Peer disconnection should trigger orders removal to all his orders.

### Node State

- [ ] Removed pair or swap client (lnd/raiden) disconnected (after timeout elapsed) should trigger order removal for all the pair's orders, and removed from connected peers' order books.
- [ ] Updated `LND-BTC`/`LND-LTC` public keys should propagate over the network.

### Swaps

- [x] Placed order should trigger a swap.
- [ ] Placed order should trigger a swap and order invalidation on the maker order to all connected peers besides the taker peer.
- [x] Swaps that use multihop routes for payment on lnd.

## Adversarial Test Cases

Adversarial test cases pit a modified version of `xud` against a standard one to see how it deals with malicious and/or unexpected behavior from other nodes. These are intended to measure and improve the robustness of `xud` against attacks, faulty nodes or connections, and potential loss of funds.

### Swap partners go offline or become unresponsive

- [x] Taker becomes unresponsive after maker confirms quantity with a `SwapAcceptedPacket`.
- [ ] Maker becomes unresponsive after maker confirms quantity with a `SwapAcceptedPacket`.
- [ ] Taker becomes unresponsive after taker set up first HTLC to the maker.
- [x] Maker becomes unresponsive after taker set up first HTLC to the maker (to be fixed: <https://github.com/ExchangeUnion/xud/issues/1048>).
- [x] Taker becomes unresponsive after maker set up second HTLC to taker (before invoice is settled) (to be fixed: <https://github.com/ExchangeUnion/xud/issues/1049>).
- [ ] Maker becomes unresponsive after maker set up second HTLC to taker (before invoice is settled).
- [x] Taker becomes unresponsive after releasing the preimage (maker doesn't get `SwapCompletedPacket`).
- [ ] Maker becomes unresponsive after the taker released the preimage (maker doesn't get `SwapCompletedPacket`) (to be fixed: <https://github.com/ExchangeUnion/xud/issues/1050>).
- [ ] Taker becomes unresponsive after the maker released preimage for first payment.

### Swap partners close channels

- [ ] Taker force-closes/cooperatively closes channel after maker confirms quantity in `SwapAcceptedPacket`.
- [ ] Maker force-closes/cooperatively closes channel after maker confirms quantity in `SwapAcceptedPacket`.
- [ ] Taker force-closes/cooperatively closes channel after taker set up first HTLC to the maker.
- [ ] Maker force-closes/cooperatively closes channel after taker set up first HTLC to the maker.
- [ ] Taker force-closes/cooperatively closes channel after maker set up second HTLC to taker (before settling invoice).
- [ ] Maker force-closes/cooperatively closes channel after maker set up second HTLC to taker (before settling invoice).
- [ ] Taker force-closes/cooperatively closes channel after preimage release (maker doesn't get `SwapCompletedPacket`).
- [ ] Maker force-closes/cooperatively closes channel after preimage release (maker doesn't get `SwapCompletedPacket`).
- [ ] Taker force-closes/cooperatively closes channel after the maker released preimage for first payment.

### Change currency ticker/token address (after https://github.com/ExchangeUnion/xud/issues/910 is merged)

- [ ] Taker changes currency in p2p messages after maker confirms quantity in `SwapAcceptedPacket`.
- [ ] Taker changes currency (create htlc on different payment channel) after maker confirms quantity in `SwapAcceptedPacket`.
- [ ] Taker changes currency (create htlc on testnet payment channel of same currency) after maker confirms quantity in `SwapAcceptedPacket`.
- [ ] Maker changes currency in p2p messages after maker confirms quantity in `SwapAcceptedPacket`.
- [ ] Maker changes currency in p2p messages after taker set up first HTLC to the maker.
- [ ] Maker changes currency (create htlc on different payment channel) after taker set up first HTLC to the maker.
- [ ] Maker changes currency (create htlc on testnet payment channel of same currency) after taker set up first HTLC to the maker.
- [ ] Taker changes currency in p2p messages after taker set up first HTLC to the maker.
- [ ] Taker changes currency in p2p messages after maker set up second HTLC to the maker.
- [ ] Maker changes currency in p2p messages after maker set up second HTLC to the maker.
- [ ] Taker changes currency in p2p message after preimage release (in `SwapCompletedPacket`).

### Other potential categories of tests

- Send more or less for swap payments.
- Change amounts in p2p communication.
- Conflicting networks  (e.g. mainnet with simnet).
- Send/receive orders over channel/payment size limit.
- Shorten cltv delta and try to trick trading partner to accept it.
- Miscellaneous p2p message alteration.
- Change xud node key after successful connection on p2p layer.
