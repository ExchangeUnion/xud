/*
Package xudtest provides testing utilities for xud.

This package contains infrastructure for integration tests that launch full xud
nodes in a controlled environment and interact with them via RPC. Using a
NetworkHarness, a test can launch multiple xud nodes, connect between them,
create defined network topologies, and anything else that is possible with
RPC commands.
