# Connext

## Installing Connext node for local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConnextProject/indra.git
cd indra
make
```

### Running Connext node

```bash
make start
```

For logs

```bash
bash ops/logs.sh node
```

## Installing Connext REST API client

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConnextProject/rest-api-client
cd rest-api-client
npm install
```

### Running Connext REST API client

Create environment variables file and point to the Etheruem and Connext node

```bash
CONNEXT_ETH_PROVIDER_URL="http://0.0.0.0:8545"
CONNEXT_NODE_URL="http://0.0.0.0:8080"
```

Then run the REST API server

```bash
npm run start
```

## Add Connext to xud.conf

```bash
[connext]
disable = false
host = "localhost"
port = 5040
```

## Add ETH currency

```bash
./bin/xucli addcurrency ETH Connext 18 --token_address="0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```

A restart of xud is currently required for it to show up under `xucli getbalance` call.

## Fund the Connext client address

Get the Connext address from the output of

`./bin/xucli getinfo`

Initialize MetaMask wallet with seed

`candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat`

This is the root treasury account for local development network/chain:

`http://localhost:8545`

After making a transfer your funds should be visible as wallet balance in the output of

`./bin/xucli getbalance`

## Open a payment channel between the node and client

`./bin/xucli openchannel Connext ETH 1`

Your funds should now be visiable as channel balance in the output of

`./bin/xucli getbalance`

## Add trading pair

`./bin/xucli addpair ETH BTC`

A restart of xud is currently required for the trading pair to be swappable.

At this point you should be able to perform ETHBTC swaps.
