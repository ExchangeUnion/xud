# Type can be 
#    feat     (A new feature)
#    fix      (A bug fix)
#    docs     (Documentation only changes)
#    style    (Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code e.g. white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
#    refactor (A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature)
#    perf     (A code change that improves performance)
#    test     (Adding missing or correcting existing tests)
#    chore    (Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation)
# An optional scope specifies the place of the commit change, e.g. orderbook, p2p, proto, swaps, etc...
# You can use * when the change affects more than a single scope.
# The subject contains succinct description of the change:
#    Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
#    Don't capitalize first letter
#    No dot (.) at the end

# BODY
# Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
# The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
